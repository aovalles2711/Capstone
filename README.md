# Capstone

This capstone project will be purposed as a exercise programming system. It will allow the user to create workouts based on the category of muscle groups, corresponding with the days of the week. Within the muscle groups will be specified exercises to target those areas.

For the purpose of utilizing the Crow's Foot Notation we will catagorize the schema as such:

a. One muscle group has many exercises.
b. One set has many repetitions.
c. One exercise has many sets.
d. One week has many days.

The muscle groups category will have a "primary key" as the weeks category will contain a "foreign key." As mentioned in the list above, all categories will have many-to-many relationships due to the corresonding nature. Tables that will relate will be the exercise and set tables.

[FINAL RESULT OF CAPSTONE] 
For the final result of my capstone, I utilized much of the similar work I've been able to do in the curriculum as well as some of the coding that has been provided through the learning videos. For example, testing models and routes/pathways in similar fashion to what is seen in the Testing videos of the curriculum as well as in the practice assessments. I've found that through reviewing my past work, this allowed me to work on a simple and straightforward application piece-by-piece.
